I created this PR to change the number of speakers,
and got a working version ready to submit.
Jan 27.

Then on Feb 12 a similar PR was merged to master,
https://github.com/moltenform/insanely-fast-whisper/commit/ffa858b1da125d8c2f62207cda17d5e8ddb8d33f
felixcarmona committed on Feb 12.

So, I guess someone else beat me to it!
